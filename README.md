## Usage 
To use access the seeded information, clone this repository to your local machine. Then open the integrated terminal in VSCode and run 'npm i' to install the dependencies in the package.json file, after that run 'npm run seed' to seed the database. Now you are ready for 'npm start' which will run the server.js file and run the local server. Now if you have the Thunder Client extension in VSCode, open a new request and put in 'http://localhost:' then whatever port it says in your terminal, and whatever route you want to get for an example: '/products' '/categories' or '/tags'. If you need more guidance on doing this, please refer to my video walk-through linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18wxvT7LWQqa7FmHCo5YQcZbMIEJWHBeH/view?usp=sharing)!
